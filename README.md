# Time Series Modeling: HMM, Kalman Filter, and LSTM

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on developing and comparing **time series models**, including:
- **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)**
- **Kalman Filter**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks**

These models are used for **sequential data analysis, state estimation, and forecasting**.
